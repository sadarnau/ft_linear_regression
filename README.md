Objective:

The aim of this project is to introduce the basic concept behind machine learning. For this project I had to create a program that predicts the price of a car by
using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm.

There is on file (estimation.py) that prompt the user to enter a mileage and then calculate the price based on the the "thetas" calculuted from the data file.
And a second one (GradientDescent.py) that will apply the gradient descent algorithm on the data file, some outputs will show all stages done to achieve this result.
